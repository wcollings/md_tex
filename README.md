# markdown-tex
A conversion tool from Markdown to Latex. A wrapper for pandoc.

This program embeds the output of pandoc into a predetermined template, with a host of additional options. Can also compile to PDF

pandoc outputs to a really fussy and weird format for TeX, so this is pre- and post-processing framework
